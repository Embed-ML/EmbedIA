class Pooling(Layer):
    """
    The Pooling layer is a layer that requires additional data beyond the input
    data. However, these values can be assigned directly to the additional data
    structure in its declaration. For this reason, it inherits from the "Layer"
    class that implements the basic behavior of an EmbedIA layer/element and
    not from the "DataLayer" class that implements an initialization function.
    This structure is declared as static in the before the invocation of the C
    function that implements the layer function.
    Normally, the programmer must implement the "predict" method, with the
    invocation to the EmbedIA function (previously implemented in "embedia.c")
    that performs the layer processing.
    This class encompasses the behavior of the pooling layers (Average, Max,
    etc.) and in principle it is not necessary to create subclasses for the
    implementation of each type. In particular it implements the
    "get_pool_name" method that uses an automatic naming rule from the name of
    the Keras pooling function for all pooling layers. The "predict" method
    invokes the C function (which must be defined in "embedia.h" and
    implemented in "embedia.c") using this name.
    Ex: For the pooling function named "avg_pool" for 2 dimensions, the C
    function named "avg_pooling2d_layer" will be called, composed by the first
    part of the name "avg" followed by "_pooling" + "input dimension" +
    "d_layer".
